Java programs demonstrating various features of the Java Collections Framework including List, Set, Map, Queue, and custom Generic List implementations.
# Java Collections

This repository contains Java programs that demonstrate how to work with different components of the **Java Collections Framework**, including:

- `List` (ArrayList, LinkedList)
- `Set` (TreeSet with custom comparators)
- `Map` (HashMap, TreeMap)
- `Queue` (FIFO and LIFO with LinkedList, Stack, Deque)
- `Iterators` and custom `Iterable` implementations

## üìÅ Folder Structure

## ‚úÖ Concepts Covered

- Java Collections API usage
- Generic programming in Java
- List slicing and subList behavior
- ListIterator traversal (forward and backward)
- FIFO and LIFO queue types
- Custom sorting using `Comparator`
- Nested Maps and Graph-like adjacency representation
- Implementing custom `Iterable<T>`

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Java-Collections.git
   cd Java-Collections
